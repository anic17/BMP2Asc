# BMP2Asc
A program to convert BMP images to ASCII.

With this little utility you can convert uncompressed BMP images to ASCII escape codes, which can then be displayed on any terminal.

## Limitations 

As BMP2Asc uses a very simple conversion, it has a bunch of limitations:
- Doesn't work with compressed images
- Only supports 24-bit true color RGB
